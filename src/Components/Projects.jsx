              <h4>Pavement Crack and Pothole Detection using Deep Learning methods</h4>
              <p>1.Using Deep Learning techniques as CNN.
                2.The Objective of the pavement crack detection techniques can accurately identify and
                extract cracks in pavement images with complex backgrounds. In this project, we are
                generating the code using Python language.
                3.Object detection using deep learning was recently well-known over the years.
